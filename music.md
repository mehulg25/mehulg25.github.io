I've been invovled with the Indian independent music scene for last 8 years now. During this period, I have had the chance to work with the following music ventures:
- [Sofar Sounds](https://www.sofarsounds.com): Artist Liaison
- [The Indian Music Diaries](https://theindianmusicdiaries.com): Community Manager
- [Humit](https://www.humit.app): Business & Growth Analyst

I have had the pleasure of collaborating with my favorite artists like Steven Wilson, The Local Train, Aswekeepsearching, Tanmaya Bhatgnagar, Parvaaz, Zygnema, Shashank Bhatnagar, and Warren Mendonsa to name a few.

Some of the acts I've witnessed live include John Mayer, Tool, Polyphia, Dance Gavin Dance, Veil of Maya, Plini, David Maxim Micic, Bloodywood, The Local Train, Lagori, Nothing Anonymous, Kayan.a, and The Revisit Project.
