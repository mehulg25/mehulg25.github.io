Hi! I'm Mehul, a Master's student at Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. I have a deep interest in data science and I aim to bridge the gap between technology and business. 

I completed my undergraduate degree from Manipal University in Computers and Communications. 

Heads Up:
- I love discussing disruptive innovations.
- I like everything classic rock, prog, djent but can still talk about John Mayer all day.
- I don't know how to dance but can headbang to odd time signatures.
- If you ever feel like listening to off scale vocals, I can sing for you
