Hi! I'm Mehul, a Master's student at Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. I have a deep interest in data science and I aim to bridge the gap between technology and business. 

My passion lies in creating value at the intersection of technology, business, and music. I have experience working with music platforms like Humit, Sofar Sounds, and The Indian Music Diaries. I had the pleasure of collaborating with my favourite artists like Steven Wilson, The Local Train, Aswekeepsearching, Tanmaya Bhatgnagar, Parvaaz, and Warren Mendonsa to name a few. 

Heads Up:
- I love discussing __disruptive innovations__.
- I like everything classic rock, prog, djent but can still talk about __John Mayer__ all day.
- I don't know how to dance but can headbang to __odd time signatures__.
- If you ever feel like listening to off scale vocals, I can sing for you (Red Flag).
