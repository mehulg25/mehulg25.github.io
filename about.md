Hi! I'm Mehul, a Master's student at [Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu). I have a deep interest in data science and I aim to bridge the gap between technology and business. 

***

My passion lies in creating value at the intersection of technology, business, and music. I have experience working with music platforms like [TuneIn](https://tunein.com), [Swaraj Labs](https://www.swaraj.art), [Humit](https://www.humit.app), [Sofar Sounds](https://www.sofarsounds.com), and [The Indian Music Diaries](https://theindianmusicdiaries.com). I had the pleasure of collaborating with my favorite artists like Steven Wilson, The Local Train, Aswekeepsearching, Tanmaya Bhatgnagar, Parvaaz, Shashank Bhatnagar, Zygnema, and Warren Mendonsa to name a few. 

Heads Up:
- I love discussing [__disruptive innovations__](https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation).
- I like everything classic rock, prog, djent but can still talk about __John Mayer__ all day.
- I don't know how to dance but can headbang to __odd time signatures__.
- If you ever feel like listening to off scale vocals, I can sing for you (Red Flag).
