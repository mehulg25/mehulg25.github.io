To cope with all the sleepless nights in pursuit of finishing my gazillion submissions, I rely on caffeine. 
NO, it doesn't help one bit! I think it's all in my head. But atleast all my Starbucks trips gave me the idea to take up this project. The aim of this project is to analyze the reviews and tips given by customers to evaluate __Starbucks Coffeehouses__ in and around College Park area.
