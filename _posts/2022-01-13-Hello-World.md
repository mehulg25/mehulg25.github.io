Hi!

As some of you might already know that I’ve been off social media for quite some time. Well, the reason why I decided to delete my social media is because I feel that I can’t be my true self. 

So, to stay in touch with all of you and keep you posted about my life, I am starting this blog. (More on this Later)

When I told some of my friends that I’m working on my blog, I got a lot of questions:
- Why do you need a blog?
- Is it because you are looking for an internship?
- Why are you choosing this theme?

And many more similar WH-questions. 

To answer all these questions, I would just like to say that it is the way it is because I like it. 

To give you a better understanding of why I am starting this blog and why I made a whole website about myself; Well, this website isn’t for anyone but for myself. I always wanted to make a website for myself.

I used to work as a full stack developer for a startup but somehow always managed to procrastinate building something for myself

Wondering what to expect from this website?

As I am living in the states and all my friends are across the globe, It gets pretty tough to find a common time to connect. And if I am connecting with you, I would prefer knowing more about your life. So, to overcome these time differences and keep you all posted on my activities, I am starting this blog. Other than blogs, you can expect to come across some of the [side projects] (/projects) I am working on, [music](/music) I am listening to, etc. 

I don’t really want to fix a schedule to update this website as I don’t want to make it a compulsion. Hence, I will just update this website whenever I feel like. 

I request you all to subscribe to my newsletter using a little pop-up window on the home page in order to receive updates. In case you don’t see any pop-up, [contact me](mailto:mehulg25@gmail.com), and I’ll manually add you to the mailing list.

Honestly, I am pretty hyped about this and I hope that you are too!
Do let me know how you feel about it.

Thank you for reading. Until next time. :)

This is the first time I’m writing a blog, so spare me for any grammatical errors.
