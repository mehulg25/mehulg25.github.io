Life is hard. Rock soft.

Hi!

If you know me then you already know what John Mayer means to me. I started listening to John Mayer back in 2016 when a friend of mine sent me a 45 second video of Mayer tracking his guitar for _The Search For Everything_. I was blown away by his guitar skills. I decided to explore this artist and the first track I heard was _On The Way Home_ from _Paradise Valley_. That’s exactly when it all started. 

Back in 2017, I was going through a tough time and started resonating with Mayer’s music more than ever. From tracks like _In Repair_ to _The Heart Of Life_, from _Stop This Train_ to _Gravity_. 

I believe that Mayer was the reason I was able to get past the lows. 

Fun story - I met this girl for the first time and she told me she didn’t like Mayer. We had an argument and I came back home. :)

Moreover, when I told my mom that I want to go to the US to pursue my masters, she thought I wanted to see Mayer perform and that’s the only reason I decided to pursue a masters degree. Was she right? I guess we will never know. 

On 23rd February 2022, I went for the Sob Rock tour with a couple of friends. Even though we were seated far from the stage and could barely see Mayer, I was happy to know that we were breathing the same air. Creepy? It is and I am well aware.

John Mayer is such a sweetheart. He apologized for not being able to sing the way he used to before he got his surgery. Moreover, He asked the crowd to help him locate a dog wearing the sob rock swag, who he saw on instagram stories just before the show. Once the dog was located, He said - “I just want to say that you are a good boy”

To summarize the concert, I believe that John Mayer is lucky to play with such talented musicians. In fact, It wasn’t Mayer who played THE guitar solo that night. Also, Mayer still got it. 
He had me in tears when he went - 

“Hurt me once, I’ll let it be

Hurt me twice, you’re dead to me

Three times makes it family

Why can’t you see, I am yours”

Thanks to  Neha for making it a memorable day.

Now that we are past February, I am excited to share that I will finally start sharing my _supreme_ music suggestions. Still need to figure out the logistics.
