Small Milestone!

Hi!

I decided to pursue my masters in Information Systems without knowing much about it. I did not have a clear roadmap of what I want to work as. All I had were 4 options in front of me:

- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Data Scientist 

At that time, I was convinced that I wanted to become a Business Analyst without even knowing the differences between the options available.

After completing 24 credits and n number of projects and assignments, I started understanding the differences and realized my interest lies in the field of data science. The only problem was that I had 0 industry experience in this field and that data science is hard. But what pushed me more to become a data scientist was an article by [HBR](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) titled - _“Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century”_. Since then, data science became my dream job.

After giving about 15 interviews and facing __300+ rejections__, I got an offer from [TuneIn](https://tunein.com) to work as a data scientist for recommendation systems and user personalization over the summer of 2022. 

TuneIn is an audio streaming platform located in the San Francisco Bay Area with only 200 employees and 75 million monthly active users being managed by it.

To work at the intersection of technology, music, and business that too as a data scientist is literally all I ever hoped for.

Today, I complete 1 month with TuneIn and I absolutely love the team and the work I am doing. However, getting till here wasn’t as easy as it sounds and I will be writing a 3 post series on how I landed this internship.

Thank you for reading. Until next time. :)

This wouldn’t have been possible without my friends.
