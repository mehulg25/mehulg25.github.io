To cope with all the sleepness nights in pursuit of finish my gazillion submissions, I rely on caffeine . NO, it doesn't help one bit. I think its all in my head. 
But atleast all my trips to Starbucks gave me the idea to pursue this project. The aim for this project is to analyze the reviews and tips given by customers to evaluate Starbucks Coffeehouses in and around College Park area.
