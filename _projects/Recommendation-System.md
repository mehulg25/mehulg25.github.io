From audio cassettes to vinyl disks, from ipods to itunes, as media products shift from physical goods to bits, the way people explore and perceive new media has also changed through the years.

The amount of data people consume every day makes it a necessity for digital companies to fine tune their selling for each user in order to create a hyper personalised environment for users to be more engaged.

Spotify, an online music streaming platform, puts user personalization at the forefront through recommended playlists. Rather than just listening to a full length album, users are able to control their experience by curating playlists that can reflect their emotions, activities, and memories. Spotify can enhance this personalization experience by assisting users in their music discovery. Discovering new tracks are made easier by offering recommendations relevant to the user.

What sets Spotify apart from other music streaming platforms like Amazon Music, Pandora, Apple Music, and YT Music is precisely the spot on recommendations that it offers users for their playlists. Through this project, we aim to see how any platform can improve its user personalization and its implications for the future of targetted marketing.

For this project, I have built a recommendation system which recommends 20 songs that a user might add to their playlist based on the first song added by the user. This recommendation system can be leveraged by platforms to further refine the precision of their recommendations to users.

In order to achieve this, I tried to analyze the data in order to find trends in user listening habits. These analysis not only helped me to optimize my recommendation system but can help all the sides of the platform involved in the following ways:

Users : To get personalized recommendations based on their listening history
Artists : To include particular attributes to make their song a hit
Streaming Platforms : To promote in-house curated playlists based on genres people like
Record Labels and Music Distributors : To sign contracts with artists who are leading the music industry
